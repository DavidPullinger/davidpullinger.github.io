    "description": "A program designed to create a video from a massive input image by recording the movement of a smaller window across the image, and outputting the window's view to a frame at each timestep (with additional options of inverting the pixel colors, or reversing the frames). These frames form a sequence suitable for video creation using tools like FFMPEG.",
