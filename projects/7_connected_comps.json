    "description": "A image processor which utilizes PGM images to extract connected components and output them in the form of a binary image. It allows users to define minimum and maximum component sizes while setting threshold values for segmentation. It employs algorithms to identify and isolate cohesive regions based on user-defined criteria, aiding in comprehensive image analysis and processing.",
